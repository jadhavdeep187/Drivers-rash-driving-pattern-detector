# Drivers-rash-driving-pattern-detector
The aim of this study is to identify patterns of different drivers and classify them based on Axis orientation, Coordinates, age, gender and others. The Rash Driving Pattern Detector uses a wide range of machine learning algorithms, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Gaussian Naive Bayes, and SVM.
